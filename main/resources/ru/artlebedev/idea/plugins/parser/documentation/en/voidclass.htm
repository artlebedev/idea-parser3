<span>This class is designed for working with "void" objects. It does not have any constructors-objects of this class are created automatically, e.g. when you refer to a variable that does not exist.
<br />

<br />
All methods of class <a href="stringclass.htm">string</a> are availbable fot this class. This mean that you can call any string's method for undefined variable without checking if it is defined first.<b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[3.4.1]</i></b>
