Building IntelliJ IDEA plugin is not as easy as it seams.

First of all, download EAP version of IntelliJ IDEA and its sources.

Open this project as a Plugin Project and add EAP version's JSDK as the project SDK,
then add lib/idea.jar and sources to JSDK (or you'll get many 'class not found' funny errors).

Change compiler options and add .p files to resources.

Also, if you want debug - start IntelliJ IDEA VM with increased PermSize (configurable
via "Edit Configurations" menu).
(IntelliJ 10.5 doesn't require this as tested. -- dwr)

Please not that in case you are developing GUI forms - use NetBeans IDE instead of IntelliJ IDEA.
