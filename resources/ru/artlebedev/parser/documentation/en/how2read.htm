<span style="font-family:FreeSetC,Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">The documentation is divided into three parts.
<br>

<br>
The first deals with practical examples of how to use Parser in handling various tasks. In this part, while creating a model site, you'll learn basic opportunities provided by this language and its most commonly used constructions. It doesn't really matter what text editor you'll choose to write code in Parser. The only thing we do recommend, however, is that the editor you choose support auto brace matching and syntax coloring. The simple reason for it is that, as your code grows bigger and more complicated, you'll find it more difficult to understand what each bracket relates to. Auto brace matching will therefore make your work a lot easier. Syntax coloring is also useful, as it makes reading and editing code easier, too.
<br>

<br>
The practical examples part is divided into lessons. Each lesson starts with working code, which may be simply copied and pasted into certain files. The whole example is then analyzed, and its logic is explained. Each lesson ends with brief enumeration of all key points and recommendations on what you should consider in the future. Close study of provided lessons will give you all knowledge you need to implement your own projects in Parser.
<br>

<br>
The second part is basic syntax reference providing rules of how to write different constructions.
<br>

<br>
The third part is the reference on operators and basic classes intended to provide descriptions of methods and brief examples of how to use them.
<br>

<br>
Information on how to install and configure Parser can be found in Appendices.
