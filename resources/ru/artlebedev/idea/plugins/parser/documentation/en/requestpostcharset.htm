During building form fields from such request the incoming data will be transcoded from this charset instead of charset specified in <a href="responsecharset.htm">$response:charset</a>.
<br />

<i>Note: if character set which specified in content-type HTTP header for incoming POST request wasn't pluged in (at configuration method for example) you will receive an error message.</i></span><span>
