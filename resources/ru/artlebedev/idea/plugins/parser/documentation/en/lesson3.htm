As our code grows bigger, we should place comments for the code to be clearly understood. In Parser, every line starting with </span><span><b>#</b></span><span> is regarded as a comment. So far, we didn't use comments, but as we step further and further, placing comments becomes nearly vital. The following line is an example of a comment:
<br />

<br />
</span><span><b>#&nbsp;all&nbsp;this&nbsp;text&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;ignored-this&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;comment&nbsp;!!!
<br />
</b></span><span>
<br />
We urge that you place comments in your code! Ideally, your code should be self-descriptive for anyone who reads it to understand the logic of the code and succession of actions. If you neglect it, you yourself may be unable to read it after a while. Remember it!

<b>What's next?
<br />
</b>In the next lesson, we will teach our calendar to place links on dates and-what is most important-we will learn how to work with forms and databases to create a full-blown news section.
