</span><span><b>What should we</b><b> remember</b><b>?
<br />
</b></span><span>Classes are the "top level" of structuring. That is why we should always aim at dividing our code into classes. By this, you can make the logic of our projects' work most comprehensible and our further work-most comfortable.
<br />

<br />
</span><span><b>What's next?
<br />
</b></span><span>By this, we have finished our exemplary site. Of course, it is not perfect and shouldn't be used as it is now. Before we place it in the Internet,<b> </b>you still have a couple of things to do: enhance our calendar in news section, teach our guestbook to check whether messages posted by visitors are correct, etc., but we didn't target at making up a full-scale site. We just wanted to show that Parser is an easy tool to increase your productivity. Now, that you have acquired all basic skills required for full-range work, you just need to reinforce them. Now you have all necessary knowledge to do the whole rest of work by yourself. Remember, "practice makes perfect."
<br />

<br />
Good luck!
